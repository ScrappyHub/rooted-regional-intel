# 🗺️ ROOTED Regional Intelligence — Macro Patterns, Community Signals & Seasonal Movement

A **macro-scale**, non-personal intelligence vertical inside the ROOTED OS.

This vertical provides **regional insights**, never individual profiling.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Includes:

- Seasonal activity patterns  
- Regional transportation flows (public data only)  
- Infrastructure load awareness  
- Community hotspot mapping (non-personal, non-crime)  
- Resource availability forecasts  
- Environmental readiness indicators  
- Civic planning visualizations (public-facing)  

ROOTED Regional Intelligence is **NOT**:

- A surveillance tool  
- A predictive policing system  
- A “people tracking” engine  
- A personal movement profiler  

ROOTED only reveals **community-scale signals**, not individual behavior.
